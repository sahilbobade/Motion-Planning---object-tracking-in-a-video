1. The trajectories
2. The lateral accelerations
3. The Speeds and the directions
4. LOS distance between the entities
5. LOS angle
6. LOS angular rate
7. LOS range rate

How to use:

1. Run the program Motion_tracking.py
2. click and drag reactange on car1 and hit enter
3. in window2 click and drag rectange on car2 and hit enter
